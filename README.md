# MOUSAI- the podcast system
Software Design & Quality Course Project
Design our application -- MOUSAI.  
MOUSAI is a podcast hosting provider with live and recorded streaming and different channels. Listeners can search for the podcast topics of their choice, listen and request to connect to a live podcast to chat and share their thoughts if the host accepts. It is a platform where everyone can podcast on their own channel and subscribe to others. So, we are always looking for an all-in-one platform to make user communication more accessible and engaging. But few popular podcasts could have all the features we need at the same time.
